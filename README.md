## Course Description

<p>If you’ve ever wondered why someone should use Git or how to use it for version control, this is a great course to get started. Join Azure MVP and GitHub Star Barbara Forbes as she guides you through the installation process, the Git workflow, setting up and pushing code into a repo, and committing changes, all with a focus on version control and how Git can help you achieve it. Find out why people use Git. Learn how Git works, locally or through a provider, and how you can get it installed, configured, and running the way you need it to work. Follow the full process of pushing your code with Git, then explore ways to make changes to files. Discover important concepts in Git, like how to ignore files you don’t want to include, how branching and merging can help you with development, what should be in a commit, and how to troubleshoot common errors.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out “Using GitHub Codespaces" with this course to learn how to get started.</p>
